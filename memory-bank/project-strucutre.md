okey and how and where the files will be for example right we are writing an endpoint where we are adding a systemd service so it have the request response objects the entity service which we are saving into db it has the function for interacting with the db and the functions or helpers for creating the ctl file templates where the files will be distributed
Edit

Great example! Let me show you exactly where each piece would go in the structure for a "systemd service management" feature.

Perfect! This shows exactly how the files are distributed across the structure. Notice how each type of code has its clear place:
Quick Summary of Where Everything Goes:

    ðŸ”µ API Routes â†’ api/v1/systemd_services.py (HTTP endpoints)
    ðŸŸ¡ Request/Response â†’ schemas/systemd_service.py (Pydantic models)
    ðŸŸ¢ Database Entity â†’ models/systemd_service.py (SQLAlchemy model)
    ðŸ”´ Business Logic â†’ services/systemd_service.py (core functionality)
    ðŸŸ  Templates & Helpers â†’ utils/ folder (supporting functions)

The Flow:

API Request â†’ Route â†’ Service â†’ Database
â†“
Templates/Helpers

Key Benefits of This Organization:

    Easy to find - developers know exactly where to look
    Single responsibility - each file has one clear purpose
    Testable - you can test each layer independently
    Scalable - add new features following the same pattern

For your systemd service example, a developer would:

    Add the endpoint in api/v1/
    Define schemas in schemas/
    Create the database model in models/
    Write business logic in services/
    Add helper functions in utils/

This gives you clean separation without the complexity of full clean architecture!
