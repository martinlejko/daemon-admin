# Server creation

- Management settings no need? Why are they there
- Make tags a bit simpler

# Servers screen

- Options enabled not really making sense
- if possible make serach responsive
- maybe also lets search by the service tags as of now pretty useless
- refresh button not working fully
- status not working always showing not working

# Services screen

- refresh button not working - probably causing the last check to be the same and not changing
- not able to delete a service
- be able to filter by server

# Service detail

- recource usage is blank
- Log filters are not design friendly
- log since should have a better design as a customer does not know what he can write there
- log filter until should also be a better design and maybe we can pick out and write
- log filter lines not really working it is always 100 and not really make sense suggest a better design

# Editing of a service

- desgin is flowed white on white text not good design for user
- some functionality is not working and dont know why is there

# Settings page

- the settings are not savable the saving state is not saved
- security is useless since not implemented
- also monitoring settings since not implemented and there is no auto collection of new data and statuses
